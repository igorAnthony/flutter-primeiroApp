 I did that application to create and share notes, allowing users to access their notes with an email and password. User authentication and authorization has been implemented using Firebase Authentication and Cloud Firestore. I used several layers to prevent the user from having direct contact with Firebase's libraries and functionality. My idea is migrate to Bloc, but I am still learning about it.
